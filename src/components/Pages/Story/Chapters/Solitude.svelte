		Now, I'm desparately trying to find a reason to live, Who cares, besides Mom
		and Dad? Trust me, They're the only reason I'm still breathing without them
		I would've been gone long ago. I mean we all need a reason to live, right? I
		can't just exist!
	</p>
	<p>
		And some people call life is a gift? I don't know if it's a gift or curse
		but all I want sometimes is to switch off my heart for a while, just to feel
		nothing.
	</p>
	<p>
		My dad and mom did everything they can for me since I was born, So If I end
		it, 20 years of their life will be wasted. I can't do that to them. I can't.
	</p>
	<p>
		So I don't have a choice. Responsibilities, whether I like my life or not,
		they're there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Time to do it. Thankfully, I had many good habit which might make my work
		easier. For example:
	</p>
	<ul class="list-decimal space-y-2">
