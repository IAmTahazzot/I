	<p>
		On the dawn of August 2nd, 2002, in the heart of South Asia, a precious
		child came into this world, igniting a flame of immeasurable joy within the
		hearts of his entire family. Thus began the poignant tale of my existence,
		woven with threads of gratitude and boundless love.
	</p>

	<p>
		As I grew, I was enveloped in the warmth of my familyâ€™s love, and I was
		taught to be kind, compassionate, and to always lend a helping hand to those
		in need. My parents, who were my guiding stars, instilled in me the values
		of honesty, integrity, and the importance of hard work.
	</p>

	<p>
		Where I was born and raised, people in the society strugling to survive let
		alone to educate or tech well manner to their children. Where on
		the other part of the world, people are living in decent lifestyle,
		educating their kids well, teching them manners and so on. I'm not
		complaining about them. It is understandable that some of us are just born
		to suffer! It's not their fault. It's just the way it is.

	<p>
		<q>**** life, Now... I don't complain that someone can have luxury life
			(good for them), it's more I like to call "Universal Balance". I mean not
			everyone can expect to be in a good family, in a good society, in a good
			environment, in a beautiful place, being beautiful or tall, handsome. None of it was our choice!</q

		So, please don't ever Judge anyone. You don't know their story!
	</p>

	<p>
		And more than 8.2 Billion people and we all are trapped in something and I'm
		one of them. I'll make skip some part of the story to keep it simple and
		short. So, let's move to the next part of the story.
