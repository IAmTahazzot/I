	<p>
		It feels like I'm standing at a crossroads, and I remember someone saying to
		choose wisely. Because, you see,
	</p>

	<p>
		<q> Choices have consequences </q>
	</p>

	<p>
		Option one: I could cry all day long and do nothing, slowly letting
		everything fade away. Or <br />
		Option two: I could get up, learn, and work, regardless of how I feel.
	</p>

	<p>
		Both choices seem bleak, but I have to choose one, and I choose the second.
		Why? Because I'm scared of the unknown, scared of what might happen if I let
		go. And honestly, I'm tired of this endless loop of thoughts.
	</p>

	<p>
		I wish there was a switch to turn off my heart for a while, just to give it
		a break from all this turmoil.
	</p>

	<p>
		So, I did something unusual. I wrote down all the worst things that happened
		or that I did. And then I tried to figure out if there was anything to fix.
		But you know what? I can't fix any of it. All I can do is start anew,
		because I can't erase what's already happened.
	</p>

	<p>To me:</p>
	<p>
		<q>
			life is like an empty canvas. You can draw anything you want on it, but
			once it's done, you can't erase it.</q>
	</p>

	<p>
		So, here's my new art: the things I'm trying hard to do and learn, even when
		it feels like a struggle. I've tried to find motivation in many things, but
		I've realized that motivation is temporary. What lasts is discipline. Good
		for me that, I already had a lot of good habits:
	</p>

	<ul class="list-disc">
		<li>
			<p>I'm a good listener</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>I love reading books (here's my few favorite books)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				I'm not on social media because I don't have any business there and I
				don't want feed my mind too much content that doesn't add value.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Doing exercise regularly at least 1:30 to 2 hours</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Sleeping early like 9PM (Sounds a bit ridiculos?)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				4 AM is when my day starts followed by a bit meditation to refresh my
				mind.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Coding a lot without being procastinate and without the fear of AI :)
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Even though I'm quite good in communication but still there is always
				room for improvements
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Less screen time. (It's a bit hard as I have do a lot of typing on VIM
				:)
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Most importantly, Being a good person. Feels good even if it's hurt
				sometimes.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		For me, time doesn't heal anything. It just teaches you how to live with the
		pain.
	</p>
	<p>For me:</p>
	<p>
		<q
			>Time doesn't heal anything at all, It just teaches you how to live with
			those pain.</q
		>
	</p>

	<p>
		I know it won't be fine instantly, but if I can hold on a little longer,
		I'll see a big difference soon.
	</p>

	<p>
		It was tough because nobody was there to help me emotionally. But you know whose fault
		that was? Mine. I never asked for help. I was scared of being judged, scared
		of being vulnerable. Stupid, I know.
	</p>
