		After moving from that place, We were in at peace for a while. I had been a
		good student including my friends (Rakib, Mohsin, Rahul, Nahid many more), I
		can't stand them, they're all just better than me. We were always competing
		each others on study. everything was kind of okay. But guess what?
	</p>

	<p class="text-red-400 font-mono">This is where everything got screwed up.</p>

	<p>
		I was coming back from college to home & what I discovered was that my
		father was severely ill. I can't tell more about it. After 10 years of
		procastination of school life, I was admitted to a college (I didn't have
		any friend there) and setting a goal to make a difference & this is what I
		got!
	</p>

	<p>
		<q>It was like a FULL STOP in my story. Everything is on except you!</q>
	</p>

	<p>
		More then 2 years of medication and hospital visits after the surgery, he is
		finally back to normal, at least that's what it is for now. I DON"T BLAME
		ANYONE FOR THIS 2 years of waste in college, Unfotunately somehow I was able
		to pass with good grade as always. Where my friends were busy with their
		preparation for the university admission, I was busy with my father's
		medication and hospital visits. yah, F*** life.
	</p>

	<p class="text-red-400">
		I hate this two things most in my whole life. When I miss here and when I
		waiting in hospital for the doctor. Trust me... It feels like I can't
		explain.
	</p>
	<p>
		Oh, Other than that, right before the college, I meet someone. Someone who I
		____ . She is smart, kind and more importantly a good person. She is a good
		artist too and she loves cats, I mean who doesn't? Well, I want to skip this
		part. I doesn't feels right to share this part of my life. I'm sorry.
	</p>

	<p class="text-red-400">
		Soooo? At this point everything I cared, loved, and wanted to do was gone.
	</p>
	<p>
		I remember the quote from "Man's search for meaning" by "Viktor E. Frankl"
		that
		<q>
			When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to
			change ourselves.
		</q>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now I'm just desparately tring to find a reason to live and even to get up
		from bed. That' how bad it is now. Watching <strong>TedX talks</strong>,
		Reading books but still nothing make sense. Sometimes it's just even harder
		to breathe and what more suffocate is that no one knows weather you're
		crying or not. Having all kind of existensional questions, why am I here?
		(hope it's a common on us). Oh, When I was in hospital I had leared many
		things & one of them was that:
	</p>
	<p>
		<q>
			You will have to walk alone some path of you life. No friends, no
			relatives, no one. Just you and it really sucks
		</q>
	</p>
	<p>I mean, we all do it at some point, most of us. Don't we?</p>
	<Spacer size={50} />
	<p>But,</p>
	<p>
		We all need that someone <br />
		Who gets you like no one else <br />
		Right when you need it the most <br /> <br />
		We all need a soul to rely on <br />
		A shoulder to cry on <br />
		A friend through the highs and the lows
