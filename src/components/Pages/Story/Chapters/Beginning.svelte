		I wrote a long story, 7-9 chapters deep. But now, but Now it feels like I
		shouldn't write much about my life for some reason. So, just 3 chapters.
		Here's how it goes.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the dawn of August 2nd, 2002, in the heart of South Asia, a precious
		child came into this world, igniting a flame of immeasurable joy within the
		hearts of his entire family. Thus began the poignant tale of my existence,
		woven with threads of gratitude and boundless love.
	</p>
	<p>
		Where I was born, people around me were not very educated. It was tough. But
		my parents? They fought for me. They pushed me to learn, and I did. From the
		very beginning I loved to learn and study from books. I soared in school,
		top of the class. My pals, Rakib, Rahul, and the rest? They were ace, too.
		And I? Just one of them, shining bright.
	</p>

	<p>
		After school, we fled the village for peace. But in 2020, just as I entered
		college, disaster struck. Dad fell terribly ill. Just when I hoped for
		focused study, BAM! Life threw me a curveball. And in college? Alone,
		without a friend in sight.
	</p>
	<p>
		By some miracle, I aced the college exam. But it didn't matter much. My
		school friends? They were all gearing up for university.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't blame anyone but me. But what went down in college and right before
		is
	</p>

	<ul class=" list-decimal space-y-2">
		<li>
			<p>Dad battled severe sickness, endured a surgery, and more.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Lost someone I deeply love.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				My grades dropped from top to bottom in two years. It hurts. I used to
				excel, now I wonder who I am.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Learned profound lessons about human nature during this tumultuous
				period.

		</li>
	</ul>

		<strong>Conclusion: Everything/ Everyone I cared & loved is GONE.</strong>

	<p>See,</p>
	<p class="quote">Choices have consequences.</p>
	<p>But many weren't mine, still, they weigh on me.</p>
